Enumeration of Minimal Unsatisfiable Cores and Maximal Satisfying Subsets
This tutorial illustrates how to use Z3 for extracting all minimal unsatisfiable
cores together with all maximal satisfying subsets.

Origin
The algorithm that we describe next represents the essence of the core extraction
procedure by Liffiton and Malik and independently by Previti and Marques-Silva:
 Enumerating Infeasibility: Finding Multiple MUSes Quickly
 Mark H. Liffiton and Ammar Malik
 in Proc. 10th International Conference on Integration of
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) techniques in
 Constraint Programming (CPAIOR-2013), 160-175, May 2013.

Z3py Features

This implementation contains no tuning. It was contributed by Mark Liffiton and it is
a simplification of one of the versions available from his Marco Polo Web site.
It illustrates the following features of Z3's Python-based API:
   1. Using assumptions to track unsatisfiable cores.
   2. Using multiple solvers and passing constraints between them.
   3. Calling the C-based API from Python. Not all API functions are
      supported over the Python wrappers. This example shows how to get a
      unique integer identifier of an AST, which can be used as a key in a
      hash-table.

Idea of the Algorithm
The main idea of the algorithm is to maintain two logical contexts and
exchange information between them:

    1. The MapSolver is used to enumerate sets of clauses that are not
       already supersets of an existing unsatisfiable core and not already
       a subset of a maximal satisfying assignment. The MapSolver uses one
       unique atomic predicate per soft clause, so it enumerates sets of
       atomic predicates. For each minimal unsatisfiable core, say,
       represented by predicates p1, p2, p5, the MapSolver contains the
       clause !p1 | !p2 | !p5. For each maximal satisfiable subset, say,
       represented by predicats p2, p3, p5, the MapSolver contains a clause
       corresponding to the disjunction of all literals not in the maximal
       satisfiable subset, p1 | p4 | p6.
    2. The SubsetSolver contains a set of soft clauses (clauses with the
       unique indicator atom occurring negated). The MapSolver feeds it a
       set of clauses (the indicator atoms). Recall that these are not
       already a superset of an existing minimal unsatisfiable core, or a
       subset of a maximal satisfying assignment. If asserting these atoms
       makes the SubsetSolver context infeasible, then it finds a minimal
       unsatisfiable subset corresponding to these atoms. If asserting the
       atoms is consistent with the SubsetSolver, then it extends this set
       of atoms maximally to a satisfying set.
